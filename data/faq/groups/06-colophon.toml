answer = "In RStudio, run [blogdown::new_site(theme = 'tomstafford/hugo-faq-theme')](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/workflow.html). Follow theme install instructions (copy .toml file and /data to root). Edit config.toml file so it knows the site name (otherwise when deployed it will fail to pull in the css). Sync to git remote repo (git init, git add ., git commit, git remote add origin reponame, git push origin master). "
