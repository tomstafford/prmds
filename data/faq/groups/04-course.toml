question = "Are there optional modules to take?"
answer = "There are no optional modules, although you have considerable scope to specialise in an area of interest when you write your literature review, carry out your data project as part of the coding module and conduct your summer research project."

question = "Which staff teach on the course?"
answer = "Staff from across the department of psychology [teach on the MSc](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/psychology/modules/msc-psychological-research-methods-data-science-modules), and supervise projects."

question = "Will I learn machine learning, deep learning, AI?"
answer = "We are not able to teach machine learning, deep learning and AI, because the course is aimed at those who are just beginning to use computational tools. There is an opportunity to use advanced techniques as part of your research project under the guidance of your supervisor"

question = "what kind of projects have been undertaken in the past, or what are the current areas available for the projects?"
answer = "Projects across all areas of psychology, and beyond, are available. The real strength of data science is that you can apply these skills to almost any research area. We try to be accomodating to students' particular interests and facilitate them doing an MSc project in the area which interests them most"

question = "Are there any research opportunities outside of the MSc research project? Research assistant roles or internships?"
answer = "There are such opportunities, although by their nature they are different year by year and they are not maintained in a centralised list. That said, the course is full time, and designed so that you produce work in the course of study to show off in a portfolio, so you have evidence to support future applications. So in our view, additonal research opportunities are not necesssary to take during the course. Get in touch if you'd like to discuss."

question = "How busy is the timetable?"
answer = "This is a full time course, with the majority of contact taking up Tuesdays and Fridays during semester time. The course is designed with the expectation that you will be spending the other days of the week in independent study"

question = "Will the course be online or offline in 2021-22"
answer = "The course is designed as an in-person, on-site course. However, it can run entirely online, so it is robust to changes required by the pandemic situation"
